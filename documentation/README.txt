To try with the inserted users, you will need the following data:

- user: root, passwd: root
- user: alfreeznx, passwd: 1234
- user: Luis4609, passwd: 1234

There are also some more files in /assets/files/uploads to try with different formats.




-- Finally, I would like to mention Félix Martínez and Luis Monzón to express my gratefulness, as they
	have helped me with several doubts and also with the implementation of a bit of Bootstrap.
